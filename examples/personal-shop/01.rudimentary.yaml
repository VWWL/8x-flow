# Personal Shop
# Personal shop is a simple e-shop which does not
# involve complicated backend systems.
# The overall procedure starts with a customer
# placed on the website. The owner of the shop
# will check the inventory to see if any of the
# purchased items are out of stock. If so, the
# owner will put these items into a separated back
# order. And ask the customer to accept back orders.
# After the customer paid. The owner will shop
# out the in-stock items. And later the back orders.
